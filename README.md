## Project Description

This project: Todoer, is a basic to-do list application built on Flask and SQLite 3. It's my implementation of the course [Python sin fronteras: HTML, CSS, Flask y MySQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-sin-fronteras-html-css-mysql/).
Created by the engineer and software instructor [Nicolás Schürman](https://www.nicolas-schurmann.com/).

The project is not exactly the same as the one developed during the course. It has bit differences, for example it uses SQLite 3 instead MySQL.

Worth mentioning that Todoer is a variant of the [Flask Tutorial Project](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/), to which I have added some improvements. The most significant is the use of [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) (free themes for Bootstrap). Both inluded from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/). And it's highly commented.
